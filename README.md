# liri-node-app

## Overview

In this app, I made LIRI. LIRI is like iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI will be a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.

	* LIRI uses the following npm packages
		* [Twitter] (https://www.npmjs.com/package/twitter)
		* [Spotify] (https://www.npmjs.com/package/spotify)
		* [Request] (https://www.npmjs.com/package/request)
		* [OMDB API] (http://www.omdbapi.com/)

# To run the app see the following instructions
1. You will need to create the following keys.js file to run this app sucessfully. Inside keys.js your file will look like this:

console.log('this is loaded');

exports.twitterKeys = {
  consumer_key: '<input here>',
  consumer_secret: '<input here>',
  access_token_key: '<input here>',
  access_token_secret: '<input here>',
}

2. Get your Twitter API keys by following these steps:

* Step One: Visit https://apps.twitter.com/app/new
* Step Two: Fill out the form with dummy data. Type http://google.com in the Website input. Don't fill out the Callback URL input. Then submit the form.
* Step Three: On the next screen, click the Keys and Access Tokens tab to get your consume key and secret.
	* Copy and paste them where the <input here> tags are inside your keys.js file.
* Step Four: At the bottom of the page, click the Create my access token button to get your access token key and secret.
	* Copy the access token key and secret displayed at the bottom of the next screen. Paste them where the <input here> tags are inside your keys.js file

# What Each Command Should Do
1. node liri.js my-tweets

	* This will show your last 20 tweets and when they were created at in your terminal/bash window.
2. node liri.js spotify-this-song '<song name here>'

	* This will show the following information about the song in your terminal/bash window

		* Artist(s)
		* The song's name
		* A preview link of the song from Spotify
		* The album that the song is from
	* if no song is provided then your program will default to
		* "The Sign"
3. node liri.js movie-this '<movie name here>'

	* This will output the following information to your terminal/bash window:

		* Title of the movie.
		* Year the movie came out.
		* IMDB Rating of the movie.
		* Country where the movie was produced.
		* Language of the movie.
		* Plot of the movie.
		* Actors in the movie.
		* Rotten Tomatoes Rating.
		* Rotten Tomatoes URL.
	* If the user doesn't type a movie in, the program will output data for the movie 'Mr. Nobody.'

4. node liri.js do-what-it-says
 
 	* Using the fs Node package, LIRI will take the text inside of random.txt and then use it to call one of LIRI's commands.
		* It should run spotify-this-song for "I Want it That Way," as follows the text in random.txt.
		* Feel free to change the text in that document to test out the feature for other commands.
